Contact List
Using jQuery and Web Storage, make a simple persistent contact list. These contacts will represent people, and will have properties like name, phone number, address, email, and more.

MVP:

Add contacts to the list.
Have all data persist in local storage.
Render the list neatly.
Be able to update the data of any contact in your list.
Be able to delete contacts.
Deployment:

Commit, push to Github, and your app working on GitHub Pages.
Extra Features:

Render your create / update forms in a modal (popup). Bootstrap has a pretty nifty modal included!
Add images to your contacts. These can be image urls (strings). Be sure to limit the rendered size of the images so they aren't too huge.
Be able to sort your contacts by any of the fields by clicking the field headers.
Have a custom search bar that will filter your contacts as you type. This will reduce your visible contacts to those which have any field that matches a part of your input.
Categorize your contacts into groups (friend, family, colleague, etc.), and allow to filter by group.
